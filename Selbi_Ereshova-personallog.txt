On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~April the beginning ~
Started learning Android on Udacity 

### ~ Mid April ~
Passed to practicing Android. For help used youtube tutorials

### ~ 24-25 April ~
Contributed to the detailed design of our project

### ~ 29 April ~
Created the splash screen of our project by following youtube tutorials. Learned about styles.xml and how to alter it to remove the title bar of the activity

### ~ 30 April ~
Commited the splash screen codes to our github repository using GitKraken. Also learned some basic git operations such as: pull, push, add, commit. 

### ~ 1 May  ~
Started working on the main screen. Implementing my knowledge on how to move from one activity to another by clicking on the button. But apparently it is not working. Will have to closer for bugs.

### ~ 3 May - 7 May  ~
Learning Firebase:70% acomplished. Did the 80% of front end of main menu. Started the question class.Debuging and learning at the same time.

### ~ 8 May -  10 May  ~
Coninued to learn firebase, how to sort the data using sortByChild method. Finished the front end (UI) for both  main menu and question screen. Strated working on the connections between the classes of our project by making texts clickable and adding buttons. Need to work on back end, but for that I need firebase dependencies set up on gradle folders. Fortunately, one of my team mates got them set up on his part of the code. Hopefully the other members can access it after we merge our code tonight

### ~ 11 May -  13 May  ~
So far the merging is going good. Had some minor problems but after discussion with my team mates we were able to solve the problems. Setting up real time firebase on our project and adding data collections.
