On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

At that time I started to learn Android Studio. Installation,  virtual device and idea of constraints - literally basics. Spent approximately 5 hours
