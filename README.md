## Project Description
AskIt is an application that will help students to get answers to their questions and cre-ate a database of questions that will be displayed as a FAQ Section. If the question that the user asks is in our database, our app will show the answer automatically. If the ques-tion is not in the database, the user will wait for an answer from other university students. This app will be easy to use as it has many user-friendly features such as filtering answers by several different criteria. It will be available for Android users at the moment.
