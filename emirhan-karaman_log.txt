On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~ 
I started to learn Android Studio from Udemy.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~ 
I watched YouTube tutorials about Android Studio, and coded OverText and AskingQuestionsScreen classes. I also coded a fake Profile class for testing my classes, because it was another friend's part.
I started learning FireBase from its documentation.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~ 
We integrated our codes and fixed the major bugs in AskingQuestionsScreen. I linked my classes with FireBase.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~ 
I linked AskingQuestionsScreen with SearchResultScreen. Now the project is working fine.
