CS102 Group1I Reflections

In this project, we have learned how to use Android Studio, Firebase and MVC design pattern, and more importantly,
how to learn new material like these. We experienced what coding and creating a project as a group feels like.
We also found out the joy and pride of seeing a project of our own work. We began our project later than we planned 
and needed to rush things and this created some problems. Working as a group, trying to create reusable classes and
trying to merge all code and come up with properly working application were difficult tasks. Thanks to our experience
obtained from this project, we would learn things and work more efficiently as a group when starting new projects in the future. However,
we think that we did a great job in a 4 week span and we are proud of our work.
