## Project Description
AskIt is an application that will help students to get answers to their questions and create a database of questions that will be displayed as a FAQ Section. If the question that the user asks is in our database, our app will show the answer automatically. If the question is not in the database, the user will wait for an answer from other university students. This app will be easy to use as it has many user-friendly features such as filtering answers by several different criteria. It will be available for Android users at the moment.
