Group work Hw1 Hangman game - 1 hour- went pretty well- everyone was present
Group discussion at Bilka- came up with some project ideas- 1 hour- everyone was present- each one of us came up with at least one idea
Forum fill out - everyone was present except me
Group discussion at Mozart cafe- every one was present- since Mr.Davenport didn’t like any of our ideas we decided to go with the most entertaining and challenging project ideas- piano teaching app ( Emirhan’s idea )
22 February - Group meeting at the library- my senior friends motivated me to choose something more serious as a project ( social media app). I thought about it and came up with some cool features that could be added to one of our previous ideas. I shared the idea with my teammates and they all approved it.- wrote report version1
David didnt like the idea. So we changed it to FAQ
